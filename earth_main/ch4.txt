---------Chapter 4 What The Hell Is This Thing!?----------

[Alarm!]
[Alarm!]
[Alarm!]
[System detects three meteorite clusters approaching!]
We encounter attack from an unknown creature. 
As I look outside of the spaceship’s window seriously, 
a huge comet that shaped like human open its eyes, and shout at us. 
Its size is much larger than a planet, and we are in danger!
So I command to our people:
“Attack!!!!”
------------------------------------------
Game starts!
------------------------------------------
After blowing up the comet creature, 
we escape quickly to avoid the rest meteorite clusters. 
That was an unexpected experience, and we went on the journey to the next planet, 
The planet of gambling.
