----------------------------------------------
We arrive at the planet of Rock and Roll.
Air is fresh.
We take up our weapons, heading out of the spaceships, but there were already enemies waiting for us.
One of the aliens speaks:
“Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! Otherwise we will attack! With our guitars!”
We dropped our weapons. 
Surprisingly, they do not attack us, Instead, the leader of the alien speaks:
“Aliens! We are a planet believing that music is the only one method that allow us to reach our heaven. 
However, none of us can play music. Before we fight with each other, 
I want to know if any of you how to sing or play instruments?”
Me: “Yeah, I can do guitar.”
So I take over the guitar in one of those aliens’ hands, and I start to play.
---------------------------------------------
Game starts!
---------------------------------------------
After I played such a beautiful song to the aliens, they all cried.
“I never! Ever! Hear a song that is so gooooood like this! Its marvelous!” One of them shout out.
Then they start to cry even harder, losing all the water inside of their body, 
and turn into mummified corpses.
We have successfully defeated the first enemy planet, congratulation! 
Then, we take on the journey to the next planet, the planet of desert.
----------------------------------------------
Loading…
We land on the planet of water to get some supplies for attacking the next planet.
Oceans, Waves, and sky. These are the only things in this planet.
We take tanks of sea water into our spaceship, 
but then we later realize that we cannot drink sea water, 
so we throw away all the water afterwards.
