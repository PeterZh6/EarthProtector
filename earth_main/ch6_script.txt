the first switch, while the bulb that is off and cold belongs to the third switch.

B. Flip the first switch on for a few seconds, then switch it off and immediately flip the second switch on. Go to the
other room and observe which light bulb is on. The bulb that is on and hot belongs to the second switch, while the
bulbs that are off and cold belong to the first and third switches.
