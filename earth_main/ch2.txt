Landing…
Time used: 4 years – 8 months – 28 days – 2 hours – 45 minutes from last destination…
--------------------------------------------------------------
We land on the planet of desert.
The Sun in this galaxy is much brighter. It’s hot, and just hot.
We find just one alien outside of our spaceship, so we talked to him.
Me: “Where are the people in this planet! 
We are here for revenge! We will kill you all!”
That alien speaks, it seems like he is very old.
“Ha…the people…all went out to attack other planets…
I am the only one left on this planet…because I don’t want to fight…”
Me: “Well, I believe you are saying the truth. 
Our spaceship is running out of fuel. Do you have any?”
The old alien: “Yes, it is in my safe locker. 
But… I forget the password of it, 
if you can help me remember the password, 
you can take any many as you want.”
Me: “Deal!” 
------------------------------------------
Game starts!
------------------------------------------
After opening the safe, I find tanks of fuel. 
I take all of them, leaving the old alien behind, 
we take on our journey to the next planet, the planet of forest.

Loading…
We just encounter a meteor cluster.
One of our people: “I do not have a good feeling…”
Me: “Same.”
Fortunately, none of our spaceships are damaged due to the meteor swarm.
