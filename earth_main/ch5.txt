---------Chapter 5 Poker Joker----------

Temperature: 21 Degree Celsius…
Humidity:  21 percent…
Landing…
Time used: 21 years – 21 months – 21 days – 21 hours – 21 minutes from last destination…
----------------------------------------
I suddenly realise that the long journey has consumed most of the money. 
Now I only have 10,000 universe dollars. I have to make some money on this planet, at least 20,0000 dollars,
as I am still several light years away from the next destination.
Fortunately, this planet is full of casinos, which remind me of the one in the move Ready Player One.
It seems that the residents of this planet are obsessed with gambling. 
After I land on the entrance of a casino, some robots come out with drinks and snacks.
The Robots: “Welcome, strangers. I know you guys have brought a lot of weapons, 
but our people here aren't fond of fighting at all. 
In fact, we are only interested in gambling.  
If you want to compete with us, then how about let's play some rounds of blackjack together. 
If you are able to beat us in gambling, you can win untold wealth. 
But if you aren't good enough, you have to worry about losing all your money 
HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa...”
The robots keep laughing, and surround me into the casino. 
The head of the robots leads me to a large table, and then pulls out a deck of poker.
He says: “Let’s play!”
------------------------------------------
Game starts!
------------------------------------------
After we win the game, the robots fulfill their promise. 
They give us all the money. With their money, 
we purchase weapons of higher technology level, cool clothes, 
and spaceships with better looking. 
We then take on the journey to the last planet, 
The planet of four-dimension.

I just heard of the four-dimensional, 
never see, or understand its true meaning. 
If two-dimension is the shadow of three-dimension, 
it is fair to say that three-dimension is the shadow of four-dimension. 
How can a planet be named after four-dimension? 
Questions rush to my mind,
making me mad, making me mindful toward crazy.
