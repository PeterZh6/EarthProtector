2089-02-14
A large alien fleet invaded Earth. 
They looked like clouds, shadows covering the planet, making day like night. 
At first, we, human, fought back. 
We used guns, machines, strategies, but none of them worked.
They were too powerful. 
They killed hundreds of millions of people, taking our cities, ruled over our people. 
But now, there is a chance to fight back, to overthrow their colonization.
My name is Vaso, a Starfleet captain of resistance. 
In the past few years, we have secretly discovered a mysterious material underground that generate infinite amount of energy, 
without any loss of the material itself. 
So we took the chance, use to be build spaceships that can reach lightspeed, 
laser guns, canons, and more powerful weapon.
Today, me and my army, under the order of our commander named Yorgos, 
are going attack the home planet of those alien enemy. 
There are in total of 5 planets of them that we are going to attack such that we can save our planet. 
They are respectively the planet of rock and roll, desert, forest, gambling, and four-dimension.
After saying goodbye to my commander and my family, I take on the journey.
“To infinity, and beyond!”
